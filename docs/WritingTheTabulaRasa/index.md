# Writing of the tabula rasa

# Abstract

# Nothing but a white empty room

What is **Tabula Rasa**? The term Tabula Rasa comes from a philosophical perspective that we all born with no knowledge at all and our brains are in blank. We write this "tablet" (tabula) with all the things we learned in the course of our life.

The name comes in reference of the roman wax tablet which was used for writing since the 8th century BC.

# The hypothesis: How to portray your mind?

# Memory and models

# How to write what you know down?

Its amusing that all titles in here are striking but this looks is different, does it? Well not really. Think about something you can do and try to explained for the first time to somebody in *blank state*, you probably need to also make them understand others things too. Let have an example: Turning a stove on.

In this part we are cutting down to the chase. We are showing down the methods and tools to display something you know in a way you can remember and other can understand.


## Classification

### Encyclopedia
An encyclopedia is the place that contains the information about a subject. In the digital era the appropriate approach is the *wiki* term since is more convenient to arrange certain topics in nested ways to be easier to access.

An encyclopedia page (or the ones about one topic) in the most complete form contains a **head** (title, introduction or abstract, an image and general information) with the basic to give the reader an start to develop the next part: the body; in this part it will cover all branches to fulfill the needs to acknowledge the subject matter. Finally there is an footer which normally contains meta data like an glossary or an bibliography for references.

Following is an explain this parts in more detail with examples.

## Assistance Tools
This are tools and practices designed not to write down knowledge but to assist this process.

### To Dos
A simple To Do reminder is an extremely simple yet effective way to remember to do something.

### Practice Tracker

### Style Check
This is the simple process of checking if the writing follows the stated style. Enforcing this is essential in the long run to preserve consistence.

### Time Tools
Time is an essential part of everything. For understanding why this is important we are going to show down trough equations.

Lets calculate how do we study:

A simple study (from an simple perspective) its composed from *reading/hearing, practices, and others methods* which we will call **r** and our brains doing understanding of this, this is going to be **b**. So far we got:

<code>
    r + b = new acknowledge
</code>

If you ever take an exam, when you are about to do it, did you feel like you needed more time? This is the same concept. Remembering something is not a job that done in a wormhole.

This is equation isn't complete because reading takes time and also the moments our brain takes to make the letters take sense. Even the fastest computer takes a little time (nanoseconds) to read and show us letters in the interface. So its impossible to us (humans) to stop time to study and then continue with our lives after it.


To accomplish a more complete equation we need to add the time we take doing each task. We will refer to time with **t**.

<code>
    (r * t) + (b * t) = new acknowledge
</code>

This isn't over yet. There is one more problem: we can't do this forever. We need to rest, eat, socialize and more. All those activities is time we has to add it to the total and its named **a**.

<code>
    (r * t) + (b * t) + (a * t) = new acknowledge
</code>

Now time is not really acknowledge, just a ingredient to the recipe, so if we remove **t** we can get how much time do we need to study thus how effective are we in timing terms. This is why a time track of the process is important.

Others tools like pomodoro technique are widely used to assist. This tools are time based experience, normally using an timer or stopwatch.

Once we know how much stress we can take and approximately how long we need we can use this tools to improve the process to reduce and control the time.
