# Writing of the tabula rasa

#### Author
Valdivia, Sebastian Ricardo

# Abstract
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, What is this about? It covers how we expand our intelect in each corner of our mind. From the beggining to the end of our lifes.

    Note: This paper does not contains any original content further than embellishment and new examples based on other authors research. All sources are listed at the bottom in the bibliography.

# Nothing but a white empty room
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is **Tabula Rasa**? The term Tabula Rasa comes from a philosophical perspective that we all born with no knowledge at all and our brains are in blank. We write this "tablet" (tabula) with all the things we learned in the course of our life.

The name comes in reference of the roman wax tablet which was used for writing since the 8th century BC. When this tablet was empty the latin phrase was *rasa* implicating there was nothing write on it. Philosophers use the expression to represent the begin of learning in the empiricism theory (that state that knowledge come from experience which is adquired since we are childrens).

## How to portray your mind?
This is the hypothesis of this essay: how to turn something in your volatile brain in a brick in the wall (figuratively, please don't smash your head) and keep it there.

In this text we analyzed the **modus operandi** of the mind to understand and memorize information and how to write down this nonconcrete data in the most effective way possible.

# Memory and models
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imagine the mind as a city a with streets, buildings, houses, etc. full of people. Small pieces of data will arrange themself to create a **model** like bricks will erect an edifice. If you need to get somewhere you travel around the streets with semaphores and heavy transit just to get to the site and either find the residence or an deserted lot.

The models are those buildings and the memory are the address.

Good memory alludes to a cartography aptitude. If I give you a domicile and a map, Can you reach there? Same with the mind, the map is there all you need is to navigate in it which isn't an easy but is the task of this essay to detail best ways to do so.

The city is always changing tho. Construction of new sites displace old numbers and make neighborhoods raise and fall. Is up to you, the conscious government, to determine what is best.

# Welding neurons
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the best way to stick something to you memory? This is a hard one. There is no simple way to, with one trick, remember that thing forever. If you analyse all the stuff you can maintaining in your brain you will realize you relive often in time because nothing is eternal (fun fact: we change ourself every time we sleep).

Did you realize how you can remember an important day like your birthday, all times, every year. This happens for several reasons but we can list the most important:

1. It's repeated over time, but not to often.
2. It an important day and some events occur which make you attached.
3. Dates are easy to understand and read (like a short number).

Now break them down and you will likely spot the pattern: **it's recurrent, cognitive and sticky**.

## Recurrence
Repetition is the one that stand out for most people, still, used wrong is proved results in lack of efficience in the long term. Repeat one sentence over and over again like a computer and then you forget it in the next day, you work harder for nothing in there.

Practice is the correct way to use repetition for learning. Repeating like a buckle will lead to intermittent information, with correct guidance it can be boosted and this essay play to lend a manual for it.

Lets use learning an instrument as an example, if you never played anything you must trust this or better yet attempt to do so.

The first days it will be a complete mess you will get confused, specially if this is your first dive into music but we will avoid to critic this initial state since it since tough moments are most yielding. After learning a thing or two about it you will start playing notes and chords to perform a song from now on all it takes is *practice* to archive more.

So practice is the strategy to succeed in mastering a skill; but how to approach it?.

There are diverse types of practice, back to the instrument example one used by young musician is *massed* practice which consists of repetition over and over again non-stop for long periods of time. Many movies are film with the protagonist using this technique. Is it the best way? No, the burnout and the stress will deplete you and after a while you won't be increasing the skill but just losing time, a more efficient alternative is using interleave practice that jumps from one point to another point but its still face the exhaustion problem. This open doors for the other type *spaced* practice, this one consists in repetition in fixed time sessions to avoid collapse, next step, as similar to the interleave practice plan, is to keep variation of affair.

With types of practice clarified lets focus in one of the most important skill to practice.

## Retrieval
So far, in this essay, we talk about display information so lets go for how to recover it.

Retrieval practice is when we retrieve knowledge from the memory. The harder it is the more compelling the result will be.

Memory has 2 states short and long term. Short term worn out in no time and even if helps to pass a test tomorrow in the next semester will fade out and any more related material won't make sense. Long term memory, on the contrary,
will weld those models for longer however it takes more to deposit information.

Effortful retrieval will slot what is been search into the long term memory. The best exercise to archive this is to land a question, hands off all material and try to give the correct response and this lead us to quizzes.

### Quizzes
This little mind games are used to get the brain to work. They are broadly used by several institutions such as schools, colleges, companies (for workers and consumers), politics and even in the entertainment industries for shows.

They can give a assessment to measure how much we know and also as a tool for gluing considering that puts the retrieval at work in particular pop quizzes because they are cast without preparation to cause troublesome and trigger memory retrieval.

There are a large brand of questions for quizzes but nearly all derivate from this basics components:
- True or False
- Multiple choice (only one, one or more true)
- Correct order
- Matching parts
- Fill the area or produce response (this one is open-ended)

Combining and expanding them to devise more alternatives like:
- Form the correct sentence
- Scale from 1 to 10
- Detailed answer: Personal formulation
- 2 options choices: T/F alternative with a slight help
- Make groups
- Correct word
- Select correct images
- Game based (puzzles) questions

TODO: explain some of this types

To name a few, however using creativity to enlarge the raw ones comes with a price of adding complexity that can confuse the student or open the question to discussion apart from mold them harder to correct.

## Gluing it all together
Effective study call for usage of arduous retrieval of information and self-evaluation. Quick exams like quizzes are a well suited for resemble all the pieces simultaneously.

Rapid tests employing questions, multiple choices, complete exercise and others will put retrieval practice at work and help to study the topic providing long term memory support.

Testing has one issue for most: anxiety and stress. Schooling and college evaluation has give the mind set that doing bad on an exam means failure, also lack of time for teachers to give proper feedback makes it useless. Nevertheless self testing shouldn't create the same emotions, the target is to study and perfect retrieval not aim for a qualification thus results aren't need to prosper after all the purpose it to learn and not to know how much we have learned.

Reading is also another habit commonly used to study but less productive, yet mixing it with note-taking or improvement of the text using different words, turns it a more capable tactic.

# Keep the engine running
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The universe is always expanding
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyday we learn new concepts and forgot others, all the models we have change continuosly and there is no hook for keep information hanging in the brain forever.

# How to write what you know down?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Its amusing that all titles in here are striking but this looks is different, does it? Well not really. Think about something you can do and try to explained for the first time to somebody in *blank state*, you probably need to also make them understand others things too. Let have an example: Turning a stove on.

- What is gas? Does it ignite?
- How is a stove composed? What are it's parts?
- How does it works?
- The steps to turn it on.
    1. Turn the handle and allow gas cross.
    2. Fire a match and bring it near the gas.
    3. Hold the fire for a second and release the handle.
- Learn new tricks to turn it faster next time.

In this part we are cutting down to the chase. We are showing down the methods and tools to display something you know in a way you can remember and other can understand.

First off when we have a model to describe there are many roads to takes us there. Some times one goes straight to destination, other we combine them and generate a route. This "*roads*" are chosen depend which is the optimal for the job. Once the route is planned it's time to assest the tools to be wield, a nice view to comprehend this is seeing it as the brush, the frame and the paint. In a *frame* the information will be disposed, second the *paintbrush* and possibly other utensil will adjust the *colors* until the image is form.

For disposing the data and refresh it, there are *assistant* tools to support the chore. 

## Information Dispose

### Encyclopedia
An encyclopedia is the place that contains the information about a subject. In the digital era the appropriate approach is the *wiki* term since is more convenient to arrange certain topics in nested ways to be easier to access.

Encyclopedia in the old form (printed books) cover each theme in alphabetical order. This method is effective if we need to locate specific information quickly in a book but it is not the way the brain store information. When we think about something we don't find it by its first letter, instead we build a path from the closest thing we remember.

If you ever forget a name of a person it likely you tried to start trying from a location related to this person: a friend with the same name, a date, a celebrity, a city, etc.; to recall this name. This process is done every time we try to look back a notion.

With the new technology we are now supplied by far more and complex search mechanisms to track down information. This are engines that craws trough text findig words, tags, images and more to hook the given data.

So humans don't store memories in a linear way but in an open and radial way. The best form to see this is using a tree. Each leave is a small piece of data. Several leaves make a branch, several branches form an entire subject and they are connected to trunk where our thoughts move like sap from the roots which are the most basic and elemental things we know and learned since our infancy (this are related to our senses).

People has invented a diagram that synthesize this and called mind map.


Mind map are diagrams designed to visually organize information in a hierarchical way in order to show how to connect different nodes (similar to a Venn diagram). However the brain doesn't create the connections at first, it creates the nodes and later the connections, the process normally goes from writing nodes ideas freely (making a soup of ideas) and then adding the connection. More of diagram like this are detailed in visual representation tools.

An encyclopedia page (or the ones about one topic) in the most complete form contains a **head** (title, introduction or abstract, an image and general information) with the basic to give the reader an start to develop the next part: the body; in this part it will cover all branches to fulfill the needs to acknowledge the subject matter. Finally there is an footer which normally contains meta data like an glossary or an bibliography for references.

Following is an explanation this parts in more detail with examples.

#### The head
This is the introductory part, its jobs in to clarify the most basic question of the subject.

One way to think about is when we first hear about something and we are interested in finding out (without a hassle) what is it. With this mindset we can use it to rely on define questions that we should answer in this section.

- How is called?
- What is it about?
- How does it looks like?


#### The body
The body contains all the information needed to fully write all the material to
complete the interpretation by the author.

#### The footer
This part contents meta information about the past parts useful for the reader to have in hand to clear any type of confusion.

Confusion can come out from specific words, lack or redundant information, uncompleted items, etc.

To list solutions to this problems we can use:
- A glossary to use for finding the meaning (inside context) of a word giving a definition for it.
- A Bibliography of books and others sources used with optional personal notes.
- Side notes or errata to resolve perplexity of the reader.

### How to guides
Guides are essential to document any process

### Cheat Sheets
### Definitions
### References
### Journals
This journals refers to an experiment/proyect journals used to takes notes and observations of the evolution of some progresive exercise and any other type or research. The effort put in conduction a trial-error experiment is usually high cost but provides a high reward since conducting your own undertaking is more lucrative to your brain than watching someone else do it.

## Tools

### Text
The most common tool for explain and describing in paperback. Probably the most accessible action to write down a thining. The process to do so is made by imagine telling it to someone else and instead of using the mouth you use your hand and place the same words in writing.

This method is easier to start but the hardest to master. To be successful is necessary to have a good vocabulary

### Diagram

#### Graph
#### Charts
#### Diagram
TODO Image mind map

### Examples

### Spread Sheets

### Analogies and Metaphors

### Mathematics
Maths are one of the rarest appliances to find. Using a mathematical statement is child's play to illustrate a concept, as long as you can figure out the interpretation and the language. The last one it's easy to fix, learning algebra may look discouraging, like starting using with any new tool till eventually it transform in a crucial part of ours life. Now with the hability of using this tool doesn't immediately shape things into form, a figural equation falls short without the proper connection to the situation.

Is a good practice is to define

## Assistance Tools
This are tools and practices designed not to write down knowledge but to assist this process.

### To Dos
A simple To-Do reminder is an extremely simple yet effective way to remember **to do** an activity. They operate comparable to stick notes.

Most of time you don't need them because you can remember what you should *do* but thats a self-lie, when you write them down its not about the task but about the importance this one have at the moment and this reason is what is forgotten.

This type of list works not only as a memo but as a self stimulus to attain a task, but normally the are keep short, absurd and in time they will look odd. An powerful advice is to also write down the justification for why should be done and how (preferentially what's should be the focus point).

### Practice Tracker
A tracker is defined to a system developed to follow or pursue tracks of a person. In case of use a practice tracker is to follow the person's  practice.

The implementation is to archive the track of the progress and regularity practice takes.

More about practice to be inspected in Welding Neurons.

### Style Check
This is the simple process of checking if the writing follows the stated style. Enforcing this is essential in the long run to preserve consistence.

Such tool is useful since helps the writer to keep the consistence without endowing a headache.

More about style and format to be inspected in Appearance Matter.

### Time Tools
Time is an essential part of everything. For understanding why this is important we are going to show down trough equations.

Lets calculate how do we study:

A simple study (from an simple perspective) its composed from *reading/hearing, practices, and others methods* which we will call **r** and our brains doing understanding of this, this is going to be **b**. So far we got:

    r + b = new acknowledge

If you ever take an exam, when you are about to do it, did you feel like you needed more time? This is the same concept. Remembering something is not a job that done in a wormhole.

This is equation isn't complete because reading takes time and also the moments our brain takes to make the letters take sense. Even the fastest computer takes a little time (nanoseconds) to read and show us letters in the interface. So its impossible to us (humans) to stop time to study and then continue with our lives after it.


To accomplish a more complete equation we need to add the time we take doing each task. We will refer to time with **t**.

    (r * t) + (b * t) = new acknowledge

This isn't over yet. There is one more problem: we can't do this forever. We need to rest, eat, socialize and more. All those activities is time we has to add it to the total and its named **a**.

    (r * t) + (b * t) + (a * t) = new acknowledge

Now time is not really acknowledge, just a ingredient to the recipe, so if we remove **t** we can get how much time do we need to study thus how effective are we in timing terms. This is why a time track of the process is important.

Others tools like pomodoro technique are widely used to assist. This tools are time based experience, normally using an timer or stopwatch.

Once we know how much stress we can take and approximately how long we need we can use this tools to improve the process to reduce and control the time.

### Encouragement
"Rome wasn't build in 1 day", its a traditional cite many people say but never ever place a single brick in a wall. During the raise of the roman empire, its romans were motivated by the wealth the armies raids bring to them, the nationalism and fear of Rome's enemies move a man from his farm to the legion lines and back to the farm again.

Romans required disipline to wake up, water the crops and train each day; and disipline was imposed to them, teached and rewarded.

Motivation is not a key to succeed, if you are motivated you are already successful. The problem is to adquire motivation to work and upkeep this state for the long run. We can find hundreds of tips to encourage to work each morning, they are all useful but most of them are repetitive and a bit personal to the author and maybe everybody should find his. Within much futher this is more a mindset than a accomplished goal, however there are universal tricks to cheat the mind to keep working in the same thing.

Reward are the easier way to motivate and the word it self always is associated with money. Well it kind of works, probably it's the reason you get up in the morning, still some reward (like money) are short.


If you start learning something with strong hype and get bored, you may be out of the immersion zone. Keeping control of yourself and how you responding to the workflow is a key to keep you head in the game. If you just repeat over and over again the same skill without adding challange, boredom and therefore failure is expected.






# Labeling Drawers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Organization is one of the more important aspects to manage a person knowledge, it affects the speed to access such thing; which is archived with proper organization.

The ability to retrieve information is a dexterity that required practice. Acquiring expertise in retrieval of information strength the path to find a memory in the brain. With decoupled information from your brain the best way to speed up the process is either but just memorizing where each this is placed at or keep a clear *path* to access it when needed. However outside the brain there is another approach.

It's easy to just throw all into one notebook on the other hand if you require to recall one subject in a place with thousands of them how much time will you spend? It can take even the same amount of learning it again.

If you keep order by relative material you can find it by going to the one you remember. If you search by the similar words or some letters like the first letter you may find it's name.
